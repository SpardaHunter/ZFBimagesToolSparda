How it works:
- Select the folder where you have the images with the "Input Folder" button. IMPORTANT: the images must have the same name as the roms.
- Select the destination folder where you want the ZFB files to be saved with the "Output Folder" button.
- Click the "ARCADE" checkbox if you want to generate ZFB files from the roms stored in "ARCADE/bin".
- Write in "CORE:" the core from which you are going to load the rom.
- Write in "EXTENSION" the extension that the rom files have (example: If the "Super Nintendo" roms are .sfc, write sfc)
- Image size: You can edit the size of the preview images of each game. With the "Fulscreen" checkbox you can create full-size images, ideally combining this method with "Game Cover Generator"
- Press the "Create ZFB files" button to start the process.
